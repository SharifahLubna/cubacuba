                    <h3>Experience helping a family that was sick</h3>
                    <p align="justify">
                        An experience that is hard for me to forget is when I heard that my father had a road accident in 2018. 
                        When I was in school, my math teacher called me into class and told me that my father had been involved in a road accident and had suffered a serious injury, namely a broken leg on the left side.
                        When I heard the news, I kept crying and didn't know what to say while my heart was beating fast.
                         At the same time, my teacher hugged me tightly, tried to calm me down, and wanted to send me to the hospital. 
                        Then, I hurried to pick up my bag and follow my teacher to the hospital.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="justify">
                        After I arrived at the hospital, I saw my family members waiting in the x-ray department. 
                        After a few hours, we waited in the x-ray room. The doctor called my mother and told me that my father's left leg was broken, and his knee was crushed. 
                        When I heard the news, I couldn't hold back the tears, and I told my family that I would take care of my father until he recovered.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="justify">
                        The next day, I missed school and cared for my father in the hospital. Even though I couldn't attend school, I didn't neglect my studies, like studying, even though I was in the hospital. For me, that is not an obstacle to continuing studying. After several weeks in the hospital, my father's condition improved, and we were allowed to go home. My family and I were pleased when my father returned home. 
                        So, that experience is difficult for me to forget because it means a lot to me. 
                        After all, I could serve my father that was sick.
